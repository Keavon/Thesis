abstract = {We introduce a novel approach that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to synthesize realistic oil painting brush strokes, where the network is trained with data generated by a high-fidelity simulator. Among approaches to digitally synthesizing natural media painting strokes, physically based simulation produces by far the most realistic visual results and allows the most intuitive control of stroke variations. However, accurate physics simulations are known to be computationally expensive and often cannot meet the performance requirements of painting applications.In our work, we propose to replace the expensive fluid simulation with a neural network. The network takes the existing canvas and a new stroke trajectory as input and produces the height and color of the new stroke as output. We train the network with a dataset generated with a high quality offline simulator. The network is able to produce visual quality comparable to the offline simulator with better performance than the existing real-time oil painting simulator. Finally, we implement a real-time painting system using the trained network.},
